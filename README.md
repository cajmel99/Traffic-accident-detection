# Traffic accident detection
The project is about detecting dangers on the road and determining if the driver should use another type of communication.

## Data
The dataset comes from The Publications Office of the European Union, which is
the official provider of publishing services to all EU institutions, bodies, and agencies.

results, procurement notices and other official information.
The data used for this project is from 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, which
